# Backlogs

- too slow: `rg bottleneck`

- currently, `./config.json` is read, meaning that you must `cargo run` in the same directory as the config file

- comments in `config.json`

- `--help`

- `--add`

- `--dry-run`

- tilde expansion `~`

- redirect `stderr` to `stdout` when executing `rsync`
